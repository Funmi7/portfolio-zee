              </h3>
              <p>
                Hello! My name is Zara Orji, a passionate, innovative product
                manager with a keen eye for detail and a drive for excellence. I
                specialize in overseeing the development and lifecyle of
                products from inception to launch. My role involves
                understanding market needs, defining product vision,
                prioritizing features and collaborating closely with cross
                functional teams to ensure successful delivery.

              <p>
                From a young age, I have been fascinated by how applications
                come to be. Even though I studied microbiology in a higher
                institution, my passion was in building applications and
                bringing products to life. This led me to begin researching and
                discovering more about product management. Furthermore, I
                decided to undertake a Google Project Management course with
                Coursera, where I gained essential project management skills
                needed to succeed as a project manager through Googleâ€™s
                methodology.
                <br />
                <br />
                Currently, I am a product manager intern with HNG which is a
                fast paced bootcamp for learning digital skills focused on
                advanced learners and those with some pre-knowledge, and it gets
                people into shape for job offers.
